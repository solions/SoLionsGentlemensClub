# SoLions Gentlemen's Club
## Basics
The Solions Gentlemen's Club is a collection of 2222 generated NFT’s living on the Solana blockchain.
Each NFT is unique and has a big variety of different characteristics (background, frame, suit, tie, head, eyes, earrings, mane, hats, cigares) and will be generated from         over 100 different features.
To ensure the safety and make it as easy as possible for our community, the collection will be minted on Magic Eden. Our team will also be doxed by them.
## Utility
### Whitelist:
Because we want to reward holders, we guarantee to every holder of a NFT from our first collection a whitelist to our future collections. The whitelist will grant you a lower mint price for our future collections
### Make your voice count: 
We’re a community driven project. This means that we will let NFT holders vote regarding the future of our project. NFT holders will also be able to choose between different NFT collections, where we will be sweeping the floors.
### Airdrops:
We want to give something back to our community, that’s why we will airdrop the NFTs from the collections we swept the floors at, to our holders. To do this we will use 50% of primary sale revenue and 5% of secondary sales.
## Focus on our Community
We aim to build an exclusive community where club members support each other.  Our goal is to bring more value to the project through time slow and steady because we believe that it’s better to have a small active community, than having a big one full of paper hands and people just looking for a quick profit.
### DYOR: 
 
Doing your own research can be exhausting and frustrating. There are so many new projects and keeping track of them is difficult, so how can we change that?
Everyone of us already made mistakes in the nft and crypto space. But it's not the mistakes that define us, it's what we learn from them. But it's even better to be able to learn from the mistakes, other people made. By bringing multiple people together, that share their knowledge, grow together, and help each other to invest in profitable projects, we could solve this problem.
### So feel yourself invited to join the SoLions Gentlemen's Club
Stay open minded, be ready to learn and share your own knowledge and enjoy the benefits of it!
## Lions together strong
