# SoLions Gentlemen's Club
## Basics
The Solions Gentlemen's Club is a collection of 2222 generated NFT’s living on the Solana blockchain.
Each NFT is unique and has a big variety of different characteristics (background, frame, suit, tie, head, eyes, earrings, mane, hats, cigares, etc) and will be generated from     over 100 different features.
To ensure the safety and make it as easy as possible for our community, the collection will be minted on Magic Eden. 
Of course our team will also be doxed by them.
## Utility
### Whitelist:
We want to reward our holders. 
By owning a phase 1 NFT you will be added to the whitelist of the future collections
Beside having an earlier and guaranteed mint the whitelist will let you mint for a lower price.
### Make your voice count: 
We’re a community driven project. This means that we will let NFT holders vote regarding the future of our project. NFT holders will also be able to choose between different NFT collections, where we will sweep the floors.
### Airdrops:
We would like to give something back to our community, so we will  buy the floor from selected collections and airdrop them to our community. To fund this we will take 50% of the proceeds from our primary and 5% from subsequent sales.
## Focus on our Community
Our ambition is to establish an exclusive community where club members support each other.  Slow and steady we will add greater value to the project because we believe that it’s better to have a small active community, than having a big one full of paper hands and people just looking for a quick profit.
### DYOR: 
Doing your own research can be exhausting and frustrating. There are so many new projects and it's really difficult to mantain an overview of all of them,                        so how can we change that?
Every single one of us already made mistakes in the nft and crypto space. But it's not the mistakes that define us, it's what we learn from them. But it's even better to be able to learn from the mistakes, other people made. By bringing multiple people together who share their knowledge, grow together, and help each other to invest in profitable projects, we could solve this problem.
### So feel yourself invited to join the SoLions Gentlemen's Club
Stay open minded, be ready to learn and share your own knowledge and enjoy the benefits of it!
## Lions together strong


### Roadmap coming soon...
